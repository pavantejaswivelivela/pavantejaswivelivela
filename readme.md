## Introduction
Hi, I’m @pavantejaswivelivela. 
I am a PhD candidate in the Mechanical Engineering Department at McGill University working on an ideation system to produce Multifunctional Bio-inspired Design (MBID). 
I work at the intersection of Bioinspiration, Material Science, Industrial Design, Mechanical Engineering, and Machine Learning. 
I hold a Master of Science (Laurea Magistrale) in Design & Engineering from the Politecnico di Milano, Italy, and a Bachelor in Mechanical Engineering from Koneru Lakshmaiah College of Engineering (KL deemed to be University), India.
