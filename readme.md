## About
Hi, I’m @pavantejaswivelivela. 
I specialise in R&D for early-stage bio-inspired multifunctional technologies, developing a **structured, morphology-driven front-end digital ideation system**—the **MBID ideation system**—that facilitates the creation of innovative multifunctional designs. My work integrates biology (morphology), product design, mechanical engineering, and Artificial intelligence to generate novel solutions across industries such as healthcare, aerospace, automotive, and marine.

By combining morphology, function, and materials, my framework offers a systematic approach to ideation, enabling researchers and industry professionals to develop structures and products with unconventional functionalities.

If you’re interested in bio-inspired innovation through a structured, first-principles approach, let’s connect.
