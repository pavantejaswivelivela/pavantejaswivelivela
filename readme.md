## About
Hi, I’m @pavantejaswivelivela. 

I am a Front-End Innovation Research Scientist specialising in the conception of **multifunctional bio-inspired structures**. I developed the **MBID ideation system**, a biological morphology-informed, rule-based concept design framework that facilitates the translation of functional biological morphological/structural strategies into novel multifunctional mechanical architectures.
My work integrates bioinspiration (morphology), product design, and mechanical engineering to generate novel solutions across various industries, including soft & micro robotics, medical tools and surgical implants, space applications, automotive, and marine.

If you’re interested in bio-inspired innovation through a structured, first-principles approach, let’s connect.
